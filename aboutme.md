title: About me
subtitle: Structural Biologist | Protein Engineer
---

## Hi, I'm Joe.  
  
I'm a **structural biologist** (I study the shape of protein molecules to understand how they work).  
  
I'm a **protein engineer** (I think about ways we can re-design protein molecules so that we can use them to do useful stuff).  
  
I'm an **evolutionary biochemist** (I study the evolutionary processes and physical mechanisms that facilitate and constrain the diversification of biological molecules).   
  
I'm a student and a teacher (I learn best through teaching).  
  
I'm a traveller and lover of the outdoors (see my other blog, [Tasmanian Traveller](tasmaniantraveller.com)).    
  
and    
  
I'm really glad you're here.
